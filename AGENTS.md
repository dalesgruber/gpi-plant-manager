# Delivery and completion rules

- When a plan is finalized, commit and push it to `origin/main` automatically. Do not wait for approval to perform the routine plan commit or push.
- Treat a pushed plan as a record of intended work only. It never means the related feature, task, or implementation is complete.
- Do not archive or mark a task complete just because its plan is committed or pushed. Before archiving, verify that every scoped implementation item is complete, the implementation commits are pushed to `origin/main`, and the required validation has passed.
- If any planned work is deferred, incomplete, or unverified, keep the task active and state that it is partially complete.
- Continue routine implementation, commits, and pushes without requesting confirmation; surface only genuine blockers, failed verification, or choices that materially change scope.
