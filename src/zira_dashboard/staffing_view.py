"""Pure render-model builder for the staffing scheduler page.

Builds the per-work-center "bays" render model and its companion
left-rail lists (Unscheduled / Reserves / Time Off) for GET /staffing.

Pure in the same sense as ``wc_dashboard_data.py``: no FastAPI / Request /
template imports, and no DB / Odoo / live_cache / attendance / scheduler I/O
of its own. The route does all the I/O (roster, schedule, Odoo time-off,
attendance) and passes the results in; this module only reshapes them. The
only collaborators are the pure helpers on ``staffing`` (LOCATIONS,
TIME_OFF_KEY, BAY_SUBTITLES, skill_color, present_operators) and the
config pass-throughs on ``work_centers_store`` (required_skills / min_ops /
max_ops / default_people) — exactly the surface ``wc_dashboard_data.py``
already leans on and that the staffing tests monkeypatch.
