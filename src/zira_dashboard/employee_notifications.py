"""Employee-facing kiosk notifications.

One row in ``employee_notifications`` == one thing to tell an employee at
their next time-clock sign-in. The only source today is time-off
resolutions (approved / denied / cancelled). ``acknowledged_at`` records
the "Got it" tap so a notification never shows twice.

Generation (``maybe_notify_resolution``) rides the time-off poller's
state-change detection in ``time_off_sync._upsert_one`` — see that module.
Display is the kiosk sign-in interstitial in ``routes/timeclock.py``.
