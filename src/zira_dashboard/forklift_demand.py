"""Pure forklift demand prediction + driver recommendation + coverage check.

v1 model (calibrated as history accumulates):
  - predict next working day from recent same-weekday snapshots (median total,
    mean per-hour shape); fall back to bootstrapping from the app's weekly
    trends when there is no same-weekday history yet.
  - recommend = ceil(busiest-hour calls / per-driver hourly throughput), min 1.
  - coverage compares the recommendation to drivers scheduled on Tablets.
