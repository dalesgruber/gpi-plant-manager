"""HTTP Cache-Control helpers for dashboard GET handlers.

Conventions:
- Past-day pages: long cache. Data is immutable.
- Today-or-future pages: short cache. Data changes throughout the shift.
- All caches are `private` (don't cache at shared proxies — content
  may include user-specific widget customizations down the line).

Usage from a handler:
    from .._http_cache import set_cache_headers
    response = templates.TemplateResponse(...)
    set_cache_headers(response, includes_today=is_today)
    return response
