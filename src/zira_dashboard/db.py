"""Postgres connection pool, helpers, and schema bootstrap.

Single point of access to the Railway-hosted Postgres database.

Usage:
    from zira_dashboard import db

    db.init_pool()             # call once at app startup
    db.bootstrap_schema()      # idempotent DDL — safe to call on every boot
    rows = db.query("SELECT * FROM people WHERE active = TRUE")
    db.execute("UPDATE people SET active = FALSE WHERE id = %s", (pid,))

    with db.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO ...")
        # commits on clean exit, rolls back on exception, returns conn always

The module never auto-initializes — importing it has no side effects. The
caller (app startup, tests, scripts) is responsible for calling init_pool().
