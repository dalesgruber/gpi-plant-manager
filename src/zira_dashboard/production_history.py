"""Per-day, per-person production attribution.

Joins published schedules (who worked where) with Zira leaderboard output
(what each WC produced) into a {person → {wc → totals}} structure used by
the VS dashboard, Player Cards, and Leaderboards features. Units and
downtime at multi-person WCs are split equally across all assigned
operators.

The pure core (`attribute_for_day`, `attribute_for_range`) takes pre-fetched
data and is fully testable. The wrappers (`attribution_for`,
`attribution_range`) call Zira and load schedules.
