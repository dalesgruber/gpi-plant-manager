"""GOAT Watch — Recycling-VS banner that surfaces operators on pace
to beat their group's all-time single-day record, and the persisted
"NEW GOAT" alert once someone actually does.

Two surfaces:

  1. **Live contenders** (during the shift, after the final break has
     passed): `contenders_for_now(day, now)` returns every group whose
     leading WC is projecting >= 98 % of that group's GOAT record.

  2. **Finalized NEW GOAT alerts**: at shift end, `finalize_day(day)`
     writes a `goat_alerts` row for every WC-day that strictly beat
     its group's record. `active_alerts(today)` returns the visible
     (un-dismissed, within next_business_day window) rows.

Detection threshold: live banner triggers at `>= 98 %` of the prior
GOAT record. The NEW GOAT alert is strict — fires only when actual
units > prior record (ties keep the existing holder).

The "credited operator" is the schedule's primary assignment for the
WC that day. The "credited WC" is the work-center itself — group
GOATs are derived per WC-day, the highest of which represents the
group's all-time best.
