"""Odoo-era attendance + absence logic (replaces the StratusTime client's
attendance_for_day / full_day_absent_names_for_day / partial_off_intervals_for_day
/ derived_absences_for_day).

Pure cores take injected punch dicts + a fixed clock so they are testable
without mocking time or Odoo. Cache-backed wrappers call Odoo via live_cache.

Identity is ``str(person_odoo_id)`` throughout, matching the rest of the
Odoo-era stack and the string-keyed late_report helpers.
