"""Per-person work-center windows derived from the local kiosk punch log
(timeclock_punches_log). A clock_in/transfer_in opens a window at its
wc_name; a transfer_out/clock_out (or the next open) closes it. Trailing
open windows (still clocked in) get end=None and are closed downstream by
assignment_windows against the shift cap.

Kiosk is still a Phase-0 pilot, so most operators have no punches yet --
punch_windows_for_day returns {} for them and the resolver falls back to
schedule + manual attributions.
