"""Kiosk time-off routes — gated by the same HMAC token as `routes/kiosk.py`.

Surfaces a touch-friendly time-off flow on the kiosk: landing with three
big-touch actions (Request Time Off / My Requests / Who's Out), the
request wizard, the mine list/detail, and the calendar. This module
currently only owns the landing route; the request wizard, mine, and
calendar pages get appended by subsequent tasks in the plan.

Auth is identical to `routes/kiosk.py`: every URL takes a 60s HMAC token
in the path, and an invalid/expired token bounces back to `/kiosk` so a
shared device never leaks one user's data to the next. The helpers
``_mint_token`` / ``_verify_token`` / ``_person_by_id`` live in
`routes/kiosk.py` and are reused here verbatim — duplicating them would
risk drift in the auth boundary.

The landing route also surfaces a warning banner if any of this person's
recent submissions are stuck in the sync queue (synced_to_odoo=FALSE AND
sync_error IS NOT NULL), mirroring the same UX pattern used on the kiosk
dashboard for stuck punches — so an employee whose request hasn't made
it to Odoo isn't left wondering why HR hasn't seen it.

Routes:
  GET  /kiosk/time-off/{token}                              Landing with 3 buttons
  GET  /kiosk/time-off/request/{token}                      Wizard step 1 — shape picker

  POST /kiosk/time-off/request/{token}/submit               Wizard step 3 — submit + queue sync
  GET  /kiosk/time-off/mine/{token}                         My Requests list
  GET  /kiosk/time-off/mine/{token}/{rid}                   My Requests detail (with Cancel)
  POST /kiosk/time-off/mine/{token}/{rid}/cancel            Cancel a pending or approved request

  POST /kiosk/time-off/mine/{token}/{rid}/edit              Persist edits + queue Odoo write
