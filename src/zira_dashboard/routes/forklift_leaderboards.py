"""Dedicated forklift-driver leaderboard: GET /staffing/forklift.

Four ranked cards (overall GOAT score, most calls, on-time %, fastest
response) over the same window presets the production leaderboards use.
Defensive: any forklift store / score-config failure degrades to empty
cards rather than 500ing the page (mirrors forklift_advisor's posture).
