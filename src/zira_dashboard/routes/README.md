# Route modules, grouped by nav section

The 35 files in this folder are mounted flat in `app.py` (each declares its
own full URL paths — no router prefixes). This index groups them by where
they surface in the UI so a newcomer can find the code behind a page.

> **Why flat, not folders?** The whole test suite monkeypatches these
> modules by dotted path (`monkeypatch.setattr(staffing, ...)` across ~40
> tests in 59 files), so moving files into packages would break imports
> everywhere for no user-facing gain. The names are already descriptive;
> this map is the "grouping" without the churn. See
> `docs/UI-ARCHITECTURE.md` for the page/URL picture.
