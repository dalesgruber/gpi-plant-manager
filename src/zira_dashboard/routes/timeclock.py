"""Timeclock — Phase 0 (Dale-only pilot).

Replaces StratusTime for clock-in/out and adds mid-shift work-center
transfers. Punches write to Odoo `hr.attendance` (sole system of record
for time-clock) and to a local `timeclock_punches_log` for offline tolerance
and audit. The kiosk is designed for touch devices in fullscreen browser
mode; the templates use big-touch / no-scroll layout.

Flow:
  1. GET  /timeclock                       — searchable / scrollable name list
  2. GET  /timeclock/start/{person_id}     — mint a token, redirect to dashboard
  3. GET  /timeclock/dashboard/{token}     — clocked-in state + actions
  4. GET  /timeclock/pick-wc/{token}       — WC picker (for override / transfer)
  5. POST /timeclock/clock-in/{token}      — open hr.attendance with WC
  6. POST /timeclock/clock-out/{token}     — close hr.attendance
  7. POST /timeclock/transfer/{token}      — close + reopen at new WC

Auth: name-pick only — no PIN, by design. Dale's call: PINs add friction
without meaningfully reducing the trust assumption (anyone on the shop
floor who could guess a PIN could also stand at the kiosk and tap a
name). The /timeclock route itself is gated behind the plant-manager session
login (RequireAuthMiddleware), so unauthenticated reach is impossible
from the public internet.

Tokens are HMAC-signed (person_id + issued-at, 60s TTL). Secret comes
from KIOSK_SESSION_SECRET; a fresh random one is generated each process
boot if the env var is unset (all tokens then invalidate on restart,
which is fine for a pilot).

Sync model: every punch writes a row to `timeclock_punches_log` first, then
the success page is rendered immediately, then a FastAPI BackgroundTask
fires the Odoo XML-RPC write off the request path. The user never waits
on Odoo. On failure the row stays at synced_to_odoo=FALSE; the 60s sweep
worker (in app.py) retries unsynced rows as a safety net.

State reads on the dashboard come from `timeclock_punches_log` too, not
Odoo — `_current_state()` is a ~5ms local SELECT vs a ~200-500ms XML-RPC
call. Local DB is safe as the source of truth so long as no one is
punching via both the kiosk and StratusTime at the same time (revisit
during plant cutover if there's a transition period).
