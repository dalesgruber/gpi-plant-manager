"""Live cache for today's StratusTime + Odoo data.

Owns three single-row JSONB tables (today_attendance_cache,
today_timeoff_cache, today_production_cache). The warmer (in app.py)
overwrites them every 45 s. Live routes read through this module
instead of calling the external APIs in the request path.

The `is_stale` helper supports the cold-start safety valve: if a route
reads a cache row whose refreshed_at is older than ~3 minutes, it can
trigger an inline refresh before returning.
