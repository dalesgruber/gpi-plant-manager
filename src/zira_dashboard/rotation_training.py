"""Level-0 training-block day effects and automatic level-1 promotion.

Two responsibilities:

- Pure per-day effects (:func:`planned_block_days`, :func:`effect_for_day`,
  :class:`BlockEffect`). These take every input explicitly; the only external
  read is ``schedule_store.current().work_weekdays`` for the working calendar,
  exactly as the plan specifies. They never touch the database or the clock.
- :func:`reconcile_blocks`, which promotes a trainee to level 1 once the block's
  requested attended days are all recorded. It reaches the database *only*
  through :mod:`rotation_store` and the shared writer in :mod:`skill_levels`, so
  it is fully monkeypatchable and has no hidden side effects.

``BlockEffect`` is shaped to match what ``rotation_suggestions`` already
consumes: ``locked_people`` occupies normal operator slots (exempt from the
level-0 exclusion and the training cap), ``temporary_extra_people`` is the
day-one supervised pair that may exceed ordinary center staffing, and
``warnings`` is passed through to the suggestion.
