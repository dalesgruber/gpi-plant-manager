"""Retro time-windowed WC attribution for production that happened at
unscheduled work centers.

When a metered work center produced units on a given day but had no one
scheduled there, we let the user retroactively attribute the production to
the person who actually worked it. The attribution flows through to
leaderboards and dashboards via ``production_history.attribute_for_day``'s
``extra_assignments`` parameter.
