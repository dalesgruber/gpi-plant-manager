"""Shared Odoo-plus-local skill-level writer.

One promotion path used by both the People Matrix cell endpoint and the
training-block completion in :mod:`rotation_training`. Callers pass *local*
``people.id`` / ``skills.id`` (training blocks store local ids). The writer
resolves the Odoo ids, pushes the level to Odoo first, then mirrors the change
into the local ``person_skills`` table and invalidates the roster + HTTP
caches.

Matrix-specific validation (skill_type, 404s, payload parsing) intentionally
stays in the endpoint; this module only knows how to persist a level.
