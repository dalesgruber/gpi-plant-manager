"""Precompute layer for daily-OK pages.

Owns the `production_daily` table: every write (nightly + live-warmer)
and every read (leaderboards, player cards, trophies, value streams)
goes through this module.

The two halves:

  - Write path:  precompute_day(day, client) — calls
    production_history.attribution_for(), flattens the nested dict into
    per-(day, emp_id, wc) rows, UPSERTs them.
  - Read path:   sum_by_range, sum_by_name, daily_records — replace the
    on-demand attribution loops that used to run inside each request.

Cores that operate on lists/dicts of rows (rank_by_category,
apply_overrides, _rank_single_day) live in their own modules and are
unaffected.
