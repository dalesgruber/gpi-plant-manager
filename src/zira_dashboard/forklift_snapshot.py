"""Orchestrate one day's forklift snapshot: fetch -> ingest -> store.

Reads the authenticated external completions feed (full history; we ask only for
calls created since the start of `day` in plant time), aggregates with the same
plant-local clock-hour bucketing as the history backfill, and UPSERTs. This
unifies the today + history paths on one source.

Called by the background warmer (and usable from a backfill script). The
`client` arg is accepted for symmetry with precompute_day but unused — the
forklift_client functions read config from env per-call. When FORKLIFT_API_KEY
is absent, fetch_completions raises ForkliftError, which the warmer swallows ->
no snapshot is written (degrades to "unavailable" rather than 500).
