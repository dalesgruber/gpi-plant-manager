"""Canonical Exception Inbox item keys.

One identity per inbox item, shared by the snapshot rows (exception_inbox) and
the resolve handlers (routes/*) so a logged inbox_events row correlates to the
open item it resolved. Keep these stable: the Phase 4 reconciler joins the open
set to the event log on this key, and the Phase 2b client diffs queue rows
against archived events by it.
