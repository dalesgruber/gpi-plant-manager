"""Background reconciliation for time_off_requests <-> Odoo hr.leave.

Mirrors the timeclock_sync.py shape: every write is recorded locally first,
then pushed to Odoo asynchronously. The local row carries a state and a
``synced_to_odoo`` flag; the request handlers schedule ``push_one`` to
run off the request path, and a 60s sweep (added in a later task) picks
up anything that failed.

This module implements two sides of the sync:

  - **Push** (``push_one``): reads a local row, routes by state, calls
    into ``odoo_client`` for the actual XML-RPC call, and updates the
    row's state + sync flags on success or its ``sync_error`` column on
    failure.
  - **Pull** (``poll_odoo_leaves``): fetches hr.leave in a rolling
    window from Odoo and upserts each into the local mirror. Normal ticks
    are incremental (only leaves whose ``write_date`` moved since the last
    poll); every 10th tick — and the first after boot — re-pulls the FULL
    window. Existing rows whose state changed trigger
    ``cascade_on_state_change``; local rows missing from Odoo are HARD
    DELETED (reverse cascade fires first), detected only on full passes.

State routing
-------------
The kiosk UI parks requests in three pre-sync states. ``push_one``
routes each to the matching Odoo workflow:

  - ``state='draft'`` + no ``odoo_leave_id`` → create a new hr.leave
    (advances local state to ``'confirm'``)
  - ``state='draft_edit'`` + has ``odoo_leave_id`` → write changed
    fields onto the existing hr.leave (back to ``'confirm'``)
  - ``state='draft_cancel'`` + has ``odoo_leave_id`` → call
    ``action_refuse`` on the existing hr.leave (advances to ``'refuse'``)

Any other state is a no-op — the row is already in a settled state and
the next pull-poller tick will reconcile it.

Dedupe guard
------------
Every create path calls ``find_duplicate_leave`` first. This protects
against the worst-case retry scenario where the original Odoo create
succeeded but the local ``UPDATE`` flipping ``synced_to_odoo`` failed
(network blip between two successful operations). Without the guard the
sweep would create a second hr.leave on retry; with it, we adopt the
existing leave's id and mark the row synced.

Errors
------
On any exception during push, we capture a short structured prefix
(``ExceptionName: message``, trimmed) into ``sync_error`` and leave the
row at ``synced_to_odoo=FALSE`` so the sweep retries it.

    1. A valid ``request_hour_from``/``request_hour_to`` window (hour-unit
       leaves — how HR enters partials, and everything the kiosk pushes),
       classified against the company shift. This deliberately outranks
       ``number_of_days``: this Odoo instance reports ``number_of_days=1.0``
       for a 45-minute hour-unit leave (and 3.0 for another one-day leave),
       so the day count cannot veto an explicit window. Whole-shift windows
       still come out ``full_day`` via the classifier's span rule, which is
       what keeps hour-unit *full* days full. Incomplete/invalid bounds
       (e.g. only ``request_hour_to=3.5``) are ignored, not trusted.
    2. ``number_of_days >= 1`` → full-day (day-unit leaves; no hour window
       to consult).
    3. The ``date_from``/``date_to`` datetime window — the only signal
       half-day (am/pm) leaves carry. Least trustworthy (per-employee Odoo
       calendar timezones are inconsistent), hence last.
    4. Nothing usable → full-day (there's no timing to show anyway).

    Classification (``classify_off_window``) turns windows into
    ``late_arrival``/``early_leave``/``midday_gap`` so the screens read
    "arrives 9:00am" / "leaves 2:00pm" / "gone 10–12" instead of a shapeless
