"""Day-before time-off reminder, computed live at clock-out.

When an employee clocks out on the last working day before approved time
off, the clock-out confirmation shows a "time off tomorrow" card. Nothing
is stored — this is recomputed on each clock-out. Only the real clock-out
endpoint calls this; transfers and auto-lunch sign-outs use other code
paths, so they never trigger it.

"Next working day" uses a simple weekend-skip rule (this is a Mon–Fri
plant). Per-person Odoo working calendars aren't cleanly available without
extra Odoo calls; this covers the plant's schedule and keeps the clock-out
hot path DB/Odoo-cheap.
