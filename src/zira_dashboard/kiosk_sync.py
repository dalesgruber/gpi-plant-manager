"""Background reconciliation for kiosk_punches_log → Odoo hr.attendance.

The kiosk route handlers do their best to write to Odoo synchronously on
each punch. When Odoo is unreachable (transient network blip, maintenance
window), the punch is still recorded in kiosk_punches_log with
synced_to_odoo=FALSE and the kiosk shows the user a success page.

This module catches up. The app's background loop calls
`retry_unsynced_punches()` every 60s — it scans unsynced rows in
chronological order and redoes the Odoo write per row. On success the
flag flips to TRUE; on failure the sync_error column is updated but the
row stays unsynced for the next tick.

Duplicate risk: if the original Odoo write succeeded but the UPDATE that
flipped synced_to_odoo failed, the retry will create a duplicate
hr.attendance. The window for this is tiny (one UPDATE between two
successful network operations) and Phase 0 is Dale-only / low-volume —
duplicates are easy to spot in audit and the simpler retry logic is
worth the trade-off. Phase 1 can add timestamp-based dedup if it ever
matters in practice.
