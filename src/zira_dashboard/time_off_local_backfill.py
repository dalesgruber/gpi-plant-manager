"""Replay locally-recorded absences into Odoo once Odoo will accept them.

A ``time_off_requests`` row with ``local_record = TRUE`` exists because Odoo
refused to validate the leave: the requested day(s) had zero working hours —
either a holiday record covered them (e.g. the plant worked the observed 4th
of July while Odoo said "closed") or the employee's Working Schedule was
missing the weekday. The approve fallback recorded the absence here and
settled the Odoo copy as refused.

This reconciler runs on an hourly warmer and, for each approved local
record, predicts whether Odoo would accept the leave *now*: at least one day
of the span is a covered weekday not blocked by a holiday record that
applies to this employee (company-wide, or scoped to their calendar). Only
when the prediction passes does it touch Odoo: reset the refused copy to
'confirm' (a live-verified state write; this Odoo has no reset action),
then approve. On success a *guarded* adoption hands the row
back to the poller (``local_record = FALSE``) — and if a kiosk cancel or
manager deny settled the row mid-replay, the guard misses, the human action
wins, and the Odoo copy is re-refused.

Bounded by design: prediction skips cost zero RPCs and defer the row's next
check (rotating it out of the candidate window so permanently-local rows
can't starve replayable ones); real failures re-refuse the Odoo copy and
back off exponentially (capped at a week), so a persistently-rejected leave
can never churn Odoo's workflow hourly forever. There is deliberately NO
recreate path: if HR deleted the refused copy, they touched it on purpose —
the absence stays app-only.
