# Odoo + Postgres Setup

The dashboard runs against two backends:

- **Postgres** — owns app state (people, schedules, work-center config, layouts, customizations, sync state). Survives deploys.
- **Odoo** — source of truth for HR data (employees + skills). Synced into Postgres on a 1-hour TTL.

## Required env vars (Railway)

Set these on the **web** service → Variables:

- `ODOO_URL` — base URL like `https://gruber-pallets.odoo.com` (no `/odoo`)
- `ODOO_DB` — database name. For Odoo.sh this is the long form like
  `odoo-ps-psus-gruber-pallets-production-30069198`. To find it, hit
  `https://<your-subdomain>.odoo.com/web/database/list` (no auth needed)
  and use the value returned.
- `ODOO_LOGIN` — username (email)
- `ODOO_API_KEY` — API key from Odoo Settings → Users → Account Security → New API Key
- `DATABASE_URL` — auto-injected by Railway when you reference the Postgres add-on; do NOT set manually

Never commit any of the above.

## First-time setup

1. **Add the Postgres add-on** in Railway: + New → Database → PostgreSQL.
2. **Reference `DATABASE_URL`** into the web service: web service → Variables → + New Variable → Add Reference → Postgres → DATABASE_URL.
3. **Set the four `ODOO_*` env vars** as above.
4. Push code. Schema bootstraps automatically on app startup.
5. **Migrate existing JSON state into Postgres** (one-shot):
   ```powershell
   $env:DATABASE_URL = "<paste from Railway → Postgres → DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL>"
   python -m scripts.migrate_json_to_postgres
   ```
   Reads the local JSON files (`roster.json`, `schedules/`, `work_centers.json`, `settings.json`, `layouts.json`, `widget_customizations.json`, `schedule.json`, `skill_filter.json`) and bulk-inserts into Postgres.

## Skill type setup in Odoo

Two skill types feed the People Matrix: **"Production Skills"** and **"Supervisor Skills"**. Skills under those types become matrix columns. Levels are bucketed to 0–3 by rank within each type.

- To add a column: add a skill to one of those types in Odoo.
- To add a level: add it under the type in Odoo. Bucket math re-distributes 0–3 across all levels.

## Routine refresh

- Auto-refresh from Odoo runs on first `/staffing/skills` GET past the 1-hour TTL.
- "Refresh from Odoo" button on the matrix forces an immediate sync.
- Sync writes to the `people`, `skills`, `person_skills` tables. The local `reserve` flag is preserved.

## Persistence behavior

All saves now hit Postgres. Reserve toggles, scheduler drafts, custom hours, settings — all survive deploys. The previous JSON-file model wiped on every redeploy; that's gone.

## What if Odoo is down?

The dashboard serves the cached Postgres data with a warning banner in the sync header. Refresh button retries on demand. The app continues to work for everything except pulling fresh employee/skill changes from Odoo.

## What if Postgres is down?

The app fails to boot until Postgres comes back. Routes return 500 on DB errors. Mitigation: Railway's managed Postgres has high uptime; check Railway status if you see persistent 500s.

## Two-way sync (planned)

The schema includes `odoo_id`, `last_pulled_at`, `last_pushed_at`, `local_dirty` columns and a `sync_outbox` table — all reserved for the eventual two-way sync (writes back to Odoo for people, skills, time off, etc.). Not yet wired up. The outbox will be drained by a background worker that pushes changes to Odoo on a periodic interval.
