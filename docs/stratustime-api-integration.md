# GPI Plant Manager — StratusTime API Integration

## What we're doing

Hey team,

We built an in-house plant-floor dashboard called GPI Plant Manager. It's the screen our supervisors and operators look at all day to see who's working, who's out, how production is tracking against goal, and where the downtime is coming from. It runs as a single web app on Railway and pulls data from a few places: our production meters (Zira), our HR system, and StratusTime for everything time-clock related.

StratusTime is where we get the source of truth for who's scheduled, who's on PTO, who's clocked in, and who's running late or absent. Throughout the workday the dashboard polls your API in the background so the on-screen view stays current without anyone hitting refresh. The polling is roughly every 45 seconds for attendance and every 3 minutes for the slower-moving stuff like the employee roster and approved time-off. We're not doing any bulk historical pulls or nightly imports right now — just keeping today's view live.

You mentioned an uptick in date-related errors and asked what we're sending. The rest of this doc lays out every endpoint we call, how often, and exactly how we format the date parameters. If you can point us at a specific call or timeframe where things are failing on your side, we can pull our logs and replay the exact request body. Happy to adjust anything we're doing that's hitting an edge case.

## Identity / auth

- **App name:** GPI Plant Manager (custom internal tool)
- **Customer alias:** `gruberpallets`
- **Web-services user:** `wsuser`
- **Hosting:** single Railway worker (one process); no horizontal scaling
- **Auth flow:**
  - `POST /service/ws-json/2.0/CreateToken` with body
    ```json
    {
      "CustomerAlias": "gruberpallets",
      "CustomerAliasExternal": "",
      "SharedKey": "<UUID>",
      "UserName": "wsuser",
      "UserPass": "<password>"
    }
    ```
  - Returned token is cached in-process for 30 minutes and refreshed on expiry or on a non-2xx response from any downstream call.

## Date format

All `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `EffectiveDate` parameters are sent in Microsoft WCF date format:

```
/Date(<epoch_ms>+0000)/
```

where `<epoch_ms>` is the **UTC-midnight** of the target date as Unix epoch milliseconds. Example for 2026-05-15: `/Date(1747008000000+0000)/`.

The code that builds these strings (Python 3.12):

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

def _wcf_date(epoch_ms: int) -> str:
    return f"/Date({epoch_ms}+0000)/"

def _epoch_ms(d):  # datetime.date
    dt = datetime(d.year, d.month, d.day, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    return int(dt.timestamp() * 1000)
```

## Endpoints called

All endpoints are v2.0 unless noted. `SELECT-ALL` / `SELECT-EMPID` refer to the `DataAction.Name` field on each request.

| Endpoint | Frequency | Date parameters | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CreateToken` | every ~30 min (token refresh only) | none | auth |
| `PingTest` | on health-check page only (rare) | none | connectivity check |
| `GetUserBasic` (SELECT-ALL) | every 5-30 min via cache + warmer | `EffectiveDate` = now | full employee roster |
| `GetUserTimeOffRequest` (SELECT-ALL) | every ~3 min via warmer + on user demand | `StartDate` = today − 3 days (UTC midnight)<br>`EndDate` = today + 3 days (UTC midnight) | approved time-off requests in a 7-day rolling window centered on today |
| `GetUserSchedule` (SELECT-ALL) | every ~60 s when computing derived absences | `StartDate` = today (UTC midnight)<br>`EndDate` = today + 1 day (UTC midnight) | who is scheduled to work today |
| `GetUserTimeOnStatusBoard` (SELECT-EMPID with list of `EmpIdentifier`s) | every 45 s | none (returns latest-punch state) | current attendance / clock-in status |
| `/service/ws-json/1.0/TimeGetPunchesByEmpIdentifier` (v1 — no v2 equivalent we could find) | every ~60 s + on user demand | `StartDate` = today − 3 days<br>`EndDate` = today + 3 days<br>`AfterModifiedOnDate` = `/Date(0+0000)/` (epoch zero) | "manual non-work shift" entries that are not exposed by `GetUserTimeOffRequest` |

### Background warmers (our side)

The Plant Manager process runs three async loops to keep caches warm:

1. **45-second loop** — refreshes attendance (`GetUserTimeOnStatusBoard`) and a composite "time-off for today" payload (which fans out to `GetUserTimeOffRequest` + `TimeGetPunchesByEmpIdentifier`).
2. **3-minute loop** — re-warms `GetUserBasic` and `GetUserTimeOffRequest` for today.
3. **30-second loop** — talks to Zira (the production meter API), not StratusTime. Listed here only to confirm it's not us.

A 12-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor` fans out the three time-off / non-work / schedule fetches in parallel when a request handler needs all three together. So you may see up to ~5 concurrent requests from us in a burst, then ~45 s of quiet.

## Example request body

`POST /service/ws-json/2.0/GetUserTimeOffRequest` for today = 2026-05-15:

```json
{
  "AuthToken": "<token>",
  "StartDate": "/Date(1746748800000+0000)/",
  "EndDate":   "/Date(1747267200000+0000)/",
  "DateTimeSchema": 0,
  "IgnoreDeletedRequests": true,
  "IgnoreDetails": false,
  "DataAction": {"Name": "SELECT-ALL", "Values": []}
}
```

## Possible sources of "date errors" worth flagging

1. **UTC midnight, not local midnight.** We send epoch ms representing UTC midnight of the target date. If StratusTime is interpreting these in the customer's local timezone (America/Chicago, UTC−5/−6), the effective day could shift by one calendar day depending on DST.
2. **±3-day padding.** Most requests for "today" actually send a 7-day window. If the error fires on a particular calendar offset (e.g. day-of-week edge cases) inside that window, our logs can show which ones.
3. **`TimeGetPunchesByEmpIdentifier` is the v1 endpoint.** We could not find a v2 equivalent that exposes the "manual non-work shift" rows. If a v2 endpoint exists for those, we'd switch.
4. **`AfterModifiedOnDate = /Date(0+0000)/`** on the v1 punches call — epoch zero. If your backend doesn't like that, we can send a more recent floor.

## Next steps

If your team can share which endpoint + which date parameter is producing the errors (and ideally a request timestamp or `CustomerAlias` hit), we can correlate it against our logs and replay the exact request body. Happy to wire up a request-body capture toggle on our side for a few hours if that would help.
