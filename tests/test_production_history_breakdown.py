"""Pure-logic tests for the excluded_minutes extension to attribute_for_day,
plus tests for attribution_for's breakdown-exclusion wiring.

Note: `test_excluded_minutes_by_person_wc_sums_closed_and_caps_open` is the
one exception to "pure" in this file -- it calls `_excluded_minutes_by_person_wc`
directly (bypassing `attribution_for`'s defensive try/except), which uses the
REAL `shift_config.productive_minutes_in_window` (not dependency-injected),
which in turn reads `breaks_for()` -> `staffing.load_schedule()` -> Postgres.
It needs a live DATABASE_URL to pass; every other test here is DB-less."""
