"""Unit tests for the downtime calculation in `leaderboard.py`.

Specifically the bug fix that subtracts break/lunch minutes from a
downtime event whose duration bleeds into a break window — the upstream
`in_shift_on` filter only catches events whose START is in a break, so
without `_adjusted_downtime` doing the break subtraction itself, the
lunch portion of a long downtime event would be incorrectly counted.
