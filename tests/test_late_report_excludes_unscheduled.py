"""Regression: people who weren't on today's schedule must never be flagged
for a missing punch.

Background: the late/absence report used to fold in "unscheduled" people
(active non-reserve roster members not assigned today) and flag them when
they hadn't punched in. After the Exception Inbox rework those rows became
*urgent* inbox items, so every active employee who simply wasn't scheduled
today flooded the inbox with "Unscheduled late · No punch yet". Per product
decision (2026-06-27) the report now covers scheduled people only.
