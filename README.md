# GPI Plant Manager

Plant operations platform for Gruber Pallets: a daily staffing scheduler,
work-center dashboards, recycling production goals, leaderboards/recognition,
and a timeclock kiosk. Server-rendered FastAPI + HTMX, backed by Postgres,
wired to the Zira.us telematics API (live production metrics) and Odoo (HR:
employees, skills, attendance, time-off). Deployed on Railway.

## Stack

- **Web:** FastAPI + uvicorn, Jinja2 templates, HTMX (server-rendered HTML).
- **Data:** Postgres (single source of truth) via psycopg2.
- **Integrations:** Zira.us API (production), Odoo XML-RPC (HR), Slack
  (schedule share), Microsoft Entra ID (OIDC login), Playwright (PDF render).

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+ and a Postgres database.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (Postgres `DATABASE_URL`,
Odoo + Zira credentials, auth secrets, etc.). The schema is created
automatically on startup by `db.bootstrap_schema()`.

## Running

```bash
zira-dashboard                      # console script
# or: uvicorn zira_dashboard.app:app
```

Set `AUTH_DISABLED=1` to bypass login during local development.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

Pure-logic tests run anywhere; tests that touch Postgres are skipped unless
`DATABASE_URL` is set.

### Optional Saturday recruiting

When optional Saturday work is needed, managers choose the requested position
counts on the Saturday Staffing page, then activate and confirm the snapshotted
shift and response deadline. Qualified hourly employees can commit through
Timeclock. Recruiting closes automatically at the nearest prior workday's
start time; then assign volunteers from **Unassigned**, resolve every
qualification shortage, and publish the schedule. Partial commitments use
30-minute increments. Employees whose exact Spanish skill level is 3 see
personalized Timeclock screens Spanish-first.

## Layout

- `src/zira_dashboard/` — the app. `routes/` holds feature routers;
  `*_store.py` = Postgres-backed persistence; `*_sync.py` = external sync
  (Odoo); `*_client.py` = API clients.
- `src/zira_probe/` — standalone Zira API capability-probe CLI; its
  `client.py` is also the dashboard's Zira client.
- `docs/object-api.md` — server-to-server Odoo-like API for internal apps.
- `docs/superpowers/` — design specs and implementation plans.

## Automatic schedule rotations

The scheduler can auto-build enabled work centers with safe, explainable
suggestions. Day-to-day manager workflow:

1. **Set scheduling preferences.** On the People Matrix, open each person's
   Scheduling Preferences icon. It lists only the qualified grouped and
   standalone targets; choose `primary`, `regular`, `occasional`, or `never`
   (missing means `regular`). Those choices influence enabled **Auto** work
   centers alongside skill level and rotation history.
2. **Choose the Auto work centers.** On Staffing, each work center has an
   **Auto** checkbox. The first run initializes these from recently used
   schedules; after that, the checked list is saved globally until changed.
3. **Pick a goal, then rebuild.** Choose **Optimized** (favor strongest
   coverage), **Normal** (balance coverage, preference, and rotation history —
   the default), or **Training** (develop level-1/2 operators paired with a
   green) before rebuilding the enabled Auto work centers.
4. **Review, then adjust.** Generated picks can show reason badges for useful
   context like primary operator, training pair, or least-recent center. Green
   names do not get a redundant badge. Manual assignments and saved default
   people are locked and survive rebuilds.
5. **Start a training protocol.** On Staffing, click **+ Training**, then
   choose the trainee, a level 3 trainer, the exact work center, start date,
   and number of attended days. The scheduler places the pair at that work
   center automatically on day one. On later attended days, add the trainer
   manually beside the trainee when continued pairing is needed.
6. **Confirm completion.** A full-day absence does not consume a training day,
   so the protocol extends automatically. After the final attended day, the
   trainee is promoted from level 0 to level 1 in every protocol skill — verify
   it landed on the People Matrix.

### Automatic Repair and Dismantle skill levels

Repair and Dismantle levels can update themselves from production. On the
**People Matrix**, hover the **Repair** or **Dismantle** header and click the
settings gear. Each group keeps its own thresholds — level 3 defaults to 90% of
goal, level 2 to 80%, and level 1 to 70%; anything lower is level 0. The modal
previews how many units per day each threshold works out to for every work
center, both for a solo operator and for two people sharing a center.

Scoring looks back 30 calendar days. A person needs at least two days with four
or more hours in the group before automation will move their level; on each day
the center's goal and output are split equally among that day's operators, and
partial days are normalized to a full shift before comparing to goal. **Save &
Recalculate** applies the new thresholds immediately, and a daily run after the
shift ends keeps eligible employees in sync. Every change is written to Odoo
first, so a rejected write leaves the level unchanged and is reported in the
run summary. Manual matrix edits still work; a later automated run may promote
or demote the same two skills.
